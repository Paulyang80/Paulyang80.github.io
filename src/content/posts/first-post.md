# Welcome!

This is my new personal website built with **Next.js 16** and **Tailwind CSS**.

## How to add a new post?

1. Create a new `.md` file in `src/content/posts/`.
2. Add the frontmatter at the top (title, date, description, tags).
3. Write your content in Markdown!

```markdown

title: "My New Post"
date: "2024-01-01"
description: "A short summary"

# Hello World

This is my content.
```

Enjoy!
